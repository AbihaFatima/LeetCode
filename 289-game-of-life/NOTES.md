- [Brute-force to optimised solution here.](https://leetcode.com/problems/game-of-life/discuss/1225591/C%2B%2B-two-approaches-with-intuition-or-faster-than-100) <br>
- Whenever we are given with matrix of zero and one, and we have to make changes in the original board and also keeping in previous values(which were changed after iterations then we can use any val/num like what we have used as 2 and 3 to remember prev. related values to it. <br>
- Brute-force sol: TC-O(mn) SC-O(mn) <br>
- Most Optimal sol: TC:O(mn) SC-O(1)<br>
