![Recursion tree for permutation of ABC](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eK9ZsXb3Qeg/UXgusEhFfoI/AAAAAAAAAOs/99btdWK1KSw/s1600/NewPermutation.gif)
<br>
The idea of this classic problem is to use backtracking.<br>
We want to get permutations, which is mainly about swap values in the list.
Consider:<br>
a --> a <br>
ab --> ab, ba <br>
abc --> abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba. <br>
...<br>
where for the length of n, the permutations can be generated by 
 1. Swap the 1st element with all the elements, including itself. <br>
 2. Then the 1st element is fixed, go to the next element. <br>
 3. Until the last element is fixed. Output. <br>
It's more clear in the figure above. The key point is to make the big problem into smaller problem, here is how to convert the length n permutation into length n-1 permutation problem. <br>
